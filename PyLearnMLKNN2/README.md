### A. Why is the data of men higher than the data of women?

Because data of male is more than female (1985 women and 4081 men, respectively).

#â€Œ## B. Why is the data of men more right than the data of women?

Because men are taller. Mean stature in male is 175 cm and in female is 163 cm.

For a better comparison, the following chart is suggested that has same density.

## Evaluate your KNN algorithm on the test dataset with different values of k = 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15.

| k      | 3      | 5      | 7      | 10      | 15      |
| :---   | :----  | :----  | :----  | :----   | :----   |
| Score  | 83.1%  | 84.7%  | 84.9%  | 85.2%   | 85.1%   |
