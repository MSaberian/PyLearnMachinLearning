### A. Why is the data of men higher than the data of women?

Because men are taller. Mean stature in male is 175 cm and in female is 163 cm.

#â€Œ## B. Why is the data of men more right than the data of women?

Because men are heavier. Mean Weight in male is 86 kg and in female is 68 kg. 

## Evaluate your KNN algorithm on the test dataset with different values of k = 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15.

| k      | 3      | 5      | 7      | 10      | 15      |
| :---   | :----  | :----  | :----  | :----   | :----   |
| Score  | 83.1%  | 84.7%  | 84.9%  | 85.2%   | 85.1%   |

## Calculate confusion matrix for test dataset.
